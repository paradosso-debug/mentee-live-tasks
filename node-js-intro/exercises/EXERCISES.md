# Node.js Terminal Exercises

Here are 20 simple Node.js exercises that students can run in the terminal. These exercises are designed to challenge novice programmers without being too difficult, and each should take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete.

## Exercise 1: Hello World

Write a Node.js program that outputs "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Exercise 2: Command Line Arguments

Create a program that accepts command line arguments and prints them to the console.
Example: `node args.js hello world` should print out the arguments "hello" and "world".

```js
// args.js
const args = process.argv.slice(2);
console.log(args);
```

## Exercise 3: Basic Calculator

Write a program that takes three command line arguments: two numbers and an operation (+, -, \*, /), then performs the calculation and prints the result.

## Exercise 4: Number Guessing Game

Create a simple number guessing game where the program picks a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it.

## Exercise 5: Palindrome Checker

Write a program that checks if a string provided as a command line argument is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

## Exercise 6: File Reader

Create a program that reads the contents of a text file provided as a command line argument and prints them to the console.

## Exercise 7: Word Counter

Write a program that reads a text file and counts the number of words in it.

## Exercise 8: FizzBuzz

Implement the classic FizzBuzz program: print numbers from 1 to n (provided as command line argument), but for multiples of 3 print "Fizz", for multiples of 5 print "Buzz", and for multiples of both print "FizzBuzz".

## Exercise 9: CSV Parser

Create a program that reads a CSV file and prints each row as a JavaScript object.

## Exercise 10: Directory Lister

Write a program that lists all files in a directory provided as a command line argument.

## Exercise 11: Prime Number Checker

Create a program that checks if a number provided as a command line argument is prime.

## Exercise 12: String Reverser

Create a program that reverses a string provided as a command line argument.

## Exercise 13: Temperature Converter

Write a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The user should provide the temperature and the unit to convert from.

## Exercise 14: Simple HTTP Server

Create a basic HTTP server that responds with "Hello, World!" for all requests.

## Exercise 15: URL Parser

Write a program that takes a URL as a command line argument and prints its different components (protocol, hostname, path, etc.).

## Exercise 16: JSON Manipulator

Create a program that reads a JSON file, modifies some values, and writes it back to a new file.

## Exercise 17: Email Validator

Write a program that validates whether a string provided as a command line argument is a valid email address.

## Exercise 18: Array Sorter

Create a program that sorts an array of numbers or strings provided as command line arguments.

## Exercise 19: Simple Task List

Write a program that allows users to add, view, and complete tasks in a simple task list stored in a text file.

Each exercise can be solved using core Node.js modules and basic JavaScript knowledge, making them suitable for novice programmers while still providing a good challenge.
